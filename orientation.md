## Carrying out Community Group Business

The Community Group will conduct its business using periodic teleconferences and on its [public mailing list](mailto:public-md-odrl-profile), which is open to members and non-members alike to [subscribe to](mailto:public-md-odrl-profile?subject=subscribe) and to [review the archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-md-odrl-profile/). 

### Member-Only Calls

Substantive decisions are confirmed on teleconferences held every two weeks, starting on Wednesday 29 April 2020. The call will take place at 1100 US Eastern Time (at present 1600 UK and Ireland, 1700 Central Europe). Since the W3C operates its teleconference system on US Eastern time, from time to time the call will change in other time zones.

The call is open to Members only, and members will receive notification of dial in details, via Webex for each call.

Teleconferences are minuted, as described below.

### W3C Mailing Lists

Please familiarise yourself with [policy for the use of and help with W3C mailing lists](https://www.w3.org/Mail).

### IRC 

Along with the voice element of the call there is also a "chat" element, which takes place on IRC (the predecessor of many modern day chat systems). Details of connecting to and using IRC for Community Grooup business, below. The IRC chat is used by the meeting chair to coordinate who is to speak, and a special person in nominated for each call to "Scribe", meaning that a record is kept in the chat of participants comments, as well as decisions (resolutions) and actions and issues gathered for consideration outside the discussion. The record thus maintained becomes the enduring minutes of the meeting, published in the public email list.

Participants may request that their comments are not scribed for the public record. If a participants comments are not scribed accurately they are expected to make that known, with a clarification, on the IRC channel.

# GitHub

GitHub is used to manage working group materials. The conventions for using GitHub for W3C business are noted here. 

Some organisations block access to `github.com` but do not block access to `github.io`. Group marterials may be read using the [`github.io` interface](https://w3c.github.io/market-data-odrl-profile). Key documents will be mirrored to the Group Home at W3C.
